## fooSAT

student solution for a SAT [competition](https://ddll.inf.tu-dresden.de/web/Forschungslinie_(SS2016)) that makes sense with the competition [environment](https://ddll.inf.tu-dresden.de/w/images/d/d2/HamiltonianCycleCompetition-Environment-SS2015.tar.gz)

**group name:** foobar

**sample graphs:** http://mat.gsia.cmu.edu/COLOR/instances.html

## Concept

see concept for problem encoding [here](https://github.com/foobar0112/fooSAT/blob/master/concept/encoding.pdf)

## build & run

run `cmake` (and/ or `make`) in project dir to build executeable

run `./fooSAT <input file>` with path to the DIMACS graph file as `<input file>` to check if graph contains Hamiltonian cycle
